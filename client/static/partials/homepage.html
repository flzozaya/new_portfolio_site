				<p>My name is Lorenzo and I am a Front-End Developer. 
				A lot of people unfamilar with the tech term, ask me: Well what does that mean? 
				The meaning of something can either be its literal/textual concept, 
				or its significant purpose someone can understand at a deeper, more meaningful, yet simpler level.
				</p>

				<p>So I say - I help regular people find a way to be more competitive online by creating a web presence for them. 
				And help businesses make the web a better place by building tools businesses and their users can find useful.
				</p>

				<p>I am fully engaged in the marriage between logic and art as an expression of web development. Meticulous, humble and a fast learner. Reflecting a life philosophy around functionality, practicality, simplicity and minimalism, with an appreciation, focus and strive for the logical aspects of digital design.
				</p>

				<p>Somewhere in between of all that, in my spare time, I have fun with cool web experiments, 
				traveling or playing soccer. I have a passion for music - playing guitar since the age of 13 - 
				and a weakness for beach volleyball. <br/>
				I also enjoy ping-pong and hiking.
